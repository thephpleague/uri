## Report Bugs and Issues

### Prior to submitting your report

- Always search the issue or pull request list first. The odds are good that if you've found a problem, someone else has found it, too. 

- Try the [last stable version](https://github.com/thephpleague/url/releases) and the [master branch](https://github.com/thephpleague/url) to see if the reported bug has not already been fixed.

### When submitting your report

- Open a new bug report for each issue

- Write a clear summary in english. A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report. It should explain the problem, not your suggested solution.

- Be brief, but don't leave any important details out. Tell us what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened

- Do not forget to mention your PHP version, the OS Platform and the package version you were using

- Don't report bugs about old versions.

## Pull Requests

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/thephpleague/url).

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow semver. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create topic branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ phpunit
```


**Happy coding**!
